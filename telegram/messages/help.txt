Welcome to our Zuri powered by ChatGPT! I'm here to help you answer your questions on a wide range of topics using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. Here are some commands you can use to interact with me:

/start - Start chatting with me.
/help - Display the list of available commands.
/stop - Stop chatting with me.

When you send a message to me, I'll use the OpenAI API to generate a response based on your message. Please note that responses may take a few seconds to generate, depending on the complexity of your question.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're always here to help you get the most out of our chatbot.
